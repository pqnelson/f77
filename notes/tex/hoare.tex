\section{Hoare Logic}
Having sketched out informally the syntax and semantics for the fragment
of \FORTRAN/ 77 our compiler is targeting, we would like to now focus on
providing a Hoare logic for the fragment of \FORTRAN/. For the most
part, this is straightforward (modulo the subtlety surrounding do-loops
always executing the body of its loop at least once). The only
difficulties we need to address are the \texttt{goto} statement and
working with arrays.

\subsection{Literature review}
Clint and Hoare provided a rule for reasoning about \texttt{goto}
statements. Later, de Bruin~\cite{deBruin1981goto} provided a system
which required working with global invariants for labeled statements.
Boyer and Moore~\cite{boyer1980vcg} have written a verification
condition generator for \FORTRAN/, which has been instructive.
The \textsc{Camfort} libraries\footnote{For example, \url{https://github.com/camfort/fortran-vars}} has produced a static toolkit for \FORTRAN/
(including \FORTRAN/ 77).

K. Zimmermann's ``Outline of a formal deﬁnition of FORTRAN'' (1969) is a
tech report lost to the sands of time, but ostensibly formalized a large
fragment of \FORTRAN/ 66 in the Vienna Definition Language.
