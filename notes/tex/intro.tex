\subsection{Why Fortran?}
Fortran is the \emph{lingua franca} for numerical analysis, and \FORTRAN/~77
is suitably simple enough for writing a compiler. It's a ``blub''
language, ostensibly describable by a Hoare logic. This gives us a way
to verify the implementation (as realized by the compiler) matches the
specification (as described by the Hoare logic).
