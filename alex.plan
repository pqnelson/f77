I have implemented the disambiguation for parse trees, to produce an AST
using de Bruijn indices. It's not hard now to write a tree-walking
interpreter for Fortran 77 using this.

The basic roadmap could be carved up thus:

- Front-end stuff
  - [ ] Typechecking
  - [ ] "Intrinsic function" support (i.e., what are the "primitive functions"
        provided by Fortran)
- Middle-end stuff
  - [ ] Transform `Program::<ast::Expr>` into a three-address code SSA
        intermediate representation
  - [ ] Optimizations (dead code elimination is dead simple in SSA)
- Backend stuff
  - [ ] Register allocation
  - [ ] Instruction selection
  - [ ] Code generation

## Intrinsic functions

The intrinsic functions provided by FORTRAN 77 need to be
implemented. I'm not going to do them all (but in principle, I
could). Following van Loan and Coleman's _Handbook for Matrix Computations_,
(SIAM, 1983?, pp. 101-103) I should support some (large subset) of:

- Integer and real functions
  - [ ] `int(x)` for sign of `x` times largest integer not greater than `abs(x)`
    (basically `int(x) = sign(floor(abs(x)),x)` as an integer)...for example: `int(-3.7) = -3`.
  - [ ] `nint(x)` for rounding to nearest integer
  - [ ] `mod(x,y) = x - y*int(x/y)`
  - [ ] `sign(x,y)` for the sign of `y` times `abs(x)`
  - [ ] `max(x1, x2, ...)` variadic maximum function
  - [ ] `min(x1, x2, ...)` variadic minimum function
- Real functions (which requires determining which of these can be
  implemented as assembly operations, and which are provided by the
  Fortran compiler as a sort of "standard library")
  - [ ] `abs(x)`
  - [ ] `sqrt(x)`
  - [ ] `exp(x)`
  - [ ] `log(x)` for natural logarithm
  - [ ] `log10(x)` for common logarithm
  - [ ] `cosh(x)`
  - [ ] `sinh(x)`
  - [ ] `tanh(x)`
  - [ ] `cos(x)`
  - [ ] `sin(x)`
  - [ ] `tan(x)`
  - [ ] `acos(x)`
  - [ ] `asin(x)`
  - [ ] `atan(x)`
- Complex functions...no...
- String
  - [ ] `length(s)`
  - [ ] `index(s1,s2)` location of `s2` in `s1`
  - [ ] `ichar(s)` converts character to integer
  - [ ] `char(i)` converts integer to character
- Type conversion
  - [ ] `int(x)` convert to integer
  - [ ] `real(x)` convert to single precision
  - [ ] `dble(x)` convert to double precision
  - `cmplx(x,y)` convert to complex (no)

There is some difficulty, as you can see, with the return type for these
functions. It's worth looking at what the [SUN Fortran 77 Compiler does](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/805-4939/6j4m0vnc8/index.html)
with its intrinsic functions.

## Intermediate Representation

Three-address code can be described as clustering "instructions" into an
array of "simple blocks". The intuition for a simple block is just a
sequence of instructions.

The instructions should be seen as an abstract assembly code. Towards
that end, usually Jouette assembly code is used as the "floor model" for
the opcodes.

There is also the "convenient fiction" of a phi statement. Basically,
this appears in assignment statements, and looks like:

```ebnf
var "=" "PHI(" var {"," var} ")"
```

The intuition is to take whichever argument of `PHI` is defined. It's
introduced to avoid duplicate variable assignments; think of a program
like:

```fortran
if (test_condition) then
    x = y1
else
    x = y2
end if
```

This would be compiled to something like

```
# in one block
t1 = y1
# in another block
t2 = y2
# in a third block
x = PHI(t1, t2)
```

For more about simple blocks, etc., see:

  Christoph Mallon, and Andreas Zwinkau,

I have refactored the structure of the abstract syntax tree to make an
expression a generic parameter. This is because the initial parse tree
cannot disambiguate a function call from an array element. (It sounds
silly, I know, but they use identical syntax in Fortran.) I've also
parametrized the specification statements by the kind of expression, for
future disambiguation.

Now, there is `parse_tree::Expr` and I hope to write an `ast::Expr`
which will use "de Bruijn indices" for the variables, function
identifiers, and subroutine identifiers.

Why do this? Well, this would allow me to clone a
`ProgramUnit::Function`, evaluate it using a tree walking interpreter,
then obtain a value (result). So I would get an interpreter for free.

The next step, before jumping to an interpreter, will be to type check
the expressions. This should be straightforward, since FORTRAN is
simpler than simply-typed lambda calculus.

We can add some minor optimization schemes here (like constant
propagation --- e.g., replacing `3*7` with `21`), but we should really
jump to three-address code and SSA.

# 2024-05-24T15:34:02-0700

So far I am making good progress with the parser, I think I'm nearly
done with a minimal working parser.

If I can disambiguate variables into local variables and
function/subroutine variables, then I can use a de Bruijn index-like
scheme, and I can get an interpreter up and running. This will be useful
for debugging purposes.

The next step after that would be to write some code generation to
produce three-address intermediate representation. If I can stick to
SSA, then I can get deadcode elimination for free.

# 2024-05-16T07:34:14-0700

Lessons I am learning from writing this compiler.

1. Write down the grammar first. Give examples for each rule (and turn
   them into unit tests for the parser).
2. Write down unit tests, think about more unit tests. You should try to
   catch as many common "typos" in the input code (i.e., the source code
   your compiler will work on) as possible as unit tests.
3. Parsing specific lessons from Fortran:
   - Don't worry too much about complications about arrays, at least not
     initially.
   - Work with the simple types first, then get to the AST. You can go
     back and add, say, arrays or parameters later on.

     - [How to test a parser?](https://langdev.stackexchange.com/q/1558/70)
4. The intermediate representation could be 3-address code (which is
   optimal for RISC targets) or 2-address code (optimal for x86 targets)

# 2024-05-14T08:42:59-0700

Before I forget, code generation and intermediate representation needs
to be researched more.

- Intermediate representation
  - SSA (static single assignment) is the hot new thing, but it might be
    overkill for my purposes; it uses $\phi(a_{1},\dots,a_{n})$ notation
    for "Use whichever one of these is defined".

  - Matthieu Lemerre, [SSA Translation is an Abstract Interpretation](https://binsec.github.io/assets/publications/papers/2023-popl-full-with-appendices.pdf)
  - Note that usually the workflow is to: (1) translate to three-address
    code, (2) convert three-address code to SSA, (3) perform
    optimizations, (4) convert optimized SSA back to three-address code.

  x86 targets)

    three-address code

    the root of an "operation tree", an idiosyncratic notion in Cooper

# 2024-05-14T08:19:50-0700

I finished the statement parsing yesterday, though I suspect there are
edgecases I have not thought about yet. (I realize that I didn't include
the `end` statement being parsed! As I am writing this, I am finishing
this portion up...)

## Program Unit Parsing

I have started programming the parsing of program units. This should be
considerably easier. The grammar for program units looks like:

```ebnf
program_unit = program | function | subroutine;

program = "program" name { specification } { statement } "end";

function = type "function" name params { specification } { statement } "end";

subroutine = "subroutine" name params { specification } { statement } "end";

params = "(" [name {"," name}] ")";

(* Section 8 of the F77 Standard *)
specification = type_declaration
              | parameter
              | equivalence
              | common
              | dimension
              | implicit
              | external
              | intrinsic
              | save;
```

I will start with just parsing the `program` and `type_declaration`
portions of the program unit.

## Refactor and Next Steps: Visitor Pattern, AST

I refactored out the data structures to a `parse_tree` module because,
well, that's what the parser is producing. The goal will be to transform
this into an `abstract_syntax_tree` where the identifiers appearing in
expressions are now "references" to the declaration of the variables,
functions, subroutines, etc. (By "reference", this could mean either a
pointer, or take advantage of the fact it refers to a local variable,
look up its type, and store the array index as the identifier.)

The transformation from parse tree to AST is rather straightforward, it
can be implemented either via functions or visitor patterns.

I should remember that there is still the matter of disambiguating
function calls from array element accesses. The parse tree will still
have "named data references" which are really nodes indicating "This is
either a function call or an array access, but I do not know which
one..." These should be completely flushed out. Transformation to AST
would be the time to do it, plus that would guarantee there are no more
named data reference nodes lingering around.

Type checking can be done via visitor pattern. Code generation can be
done via visitor pattern.

It seems the best thing to do would be:

- [ ] Finish parsing program units
- [ ] Write up `ast::Expr`, `ast::Statement`, `ast::ProgramUnit` data
      structures and a translation from `parse_tree::*` counterparts to
      these ast data structures
- [ ] Write up `ast::expr::Visitor`, `ast::stmt::Visitor`, and
      `ast::unit::Visitor` traits for later use
- [ ] Consider refactoring all the relevant position information to its
      own data structure `Pos` which would be populated in the parse
      tree, then transported along to the `ast::*` data structures (for
      debugging purposes)

# 2024-05-12T19:18:39-0700

Remembering some bits of x86 assembly with AT&T syntax:

- `lea <mem>, <reg32>` loads effective address, places the address
  specified by the 
  first operand into the register specified by the second operand
- `mov` moves data referred by the first operand into the location given
  by the second operand
- `rbp` is the frame base pointer [hence "bp"] in x86-64, `rsp` is the
  stack pointer [hence "sp"]
- `symbol@GOTOFF` addresses the variable itself, relative to the GOT
  base (a convenient but arbitrary choice of anchor). This usually
  appears as the first operand in a `leal` instruction in a lot of
  disassembly. 

# 2024-05-12T11:58:44-0700

So this should conclude the parsing of expressions, which means I can
begin parsing statements. I should really spend more time writing unit
tests for all possible expressions in Fortran, but I'm mildly confident
it works fine.

# 2024-05-12T09:35:00-0700

It dawns on me that I am going to need to parse `write (*,*) <iolist>`
and `read (*,*) <iolist>` specially. Fortunately I have `Read` and
`Write` as special tokens.

And Fortran has some peculiar quirks concerning dummy arguments (which
are `*` passed as function arguments).

```ebnf
array-or-funcall = funcall | array-element-or-slice;

funcall = identifier "(" ")"
        | identifier "(" expr {, expr} ")" ;

(* R612 and R613 *)
data-ref = identifier
         | identifier "(" section-subscript {"," section-subscript} ")" ;

(* R615 *)
array-element = data-ref;

(* R616 *)
array-section = data-ref
              | data-ref "(" [scalar-int-expr] ":" [scalar-int-expr] ")";

subscript = int-scalar-expr; (* R617 *)

(* R618 *)
section-subscript = subscript
                   | subscript-triplet
                   | vector-subscript;
subscript-triplet = [subscript] ":" [subscript] [":" stride]; (* R619 *)
stride = scalar-int-expr; (* R620 *)
```

Some examples:
- `A(x)` is an array element
- `A(1, 2)` is an array element
- `A(1:N:2, M)` is a rank-one array section
- `B(:,:,:)` is an array section when `B` is an array of rank-3
- `A(3:5,2,1:2)` is an array section with shape `(3,2)`

# 2024-05-12T09:20:58-0700

I caught a bug with `Parser::consume()` which was silly. I also caught a
bug with scanning an identifier, thanks to trying to parse function
names --- `f()` was scanned as `Identifier::("f(")` followed by `RightParen`.
It's good that I am unit testing as I go along, otherwise I would never
catch these bugs!

So far I have supported variables and "simple" function calls (i.e.,
function calls requiring no arguments). The next task is
arrays. This...well, it's going to be a horrible mess.

# 2024-05-12T08:35:56-0700

After adding support for variables, I looked around and found Frank
Lhota wrote a
[Flex/Bison parser](https://github.com/FrankLhota56/fortran66-flex/) 
for FORTRAN 66. It's interesting to see what 
the grammar looks like. It appears much simpler in some regards. Well,
the [FORTRAN 66 Standard](https://wg5-fortran.org/ARCHIVE/Fortran66.pdf)
is merely 39 pages (compared to the 223 pages for FORTRAN 77) and arrays
were limited to be of rank no greater than 3. Array slices were not a
"thing" in FORTRAN 66.

In FORTRAN 77, array slices weren't really part of the Standard
either. But substrings were specified using colons (e.g., `NAME(3:17)`).

So now I have a decision to make, I can:

1. Adhere to the FORTRAN 77 Standard and only support array slices for
   strings, or
2. Support Fortran 90 array slices in general.

It seems that the second choice is more general and easier to implement. 

# 2024-05-12T07:21:58-0700

I am planning to work out a few more unit tests, to make sure that the
parser is parsing expressions as intended.

I have added the grammar rules for expressions as comments, to remind
myself of what each function is supposed to do.

My current plan:
- [ ] Unit test more expressions
- [ ] Parse named data references

## Named Data References

This term seems to be used in the Fortran 90 grammars. Broadly, it
refers to:

- variables
- function calls
- array elements

The FORTRAN 77 Standard 6.1.2.1 defines a primary expression as
consisting of:

> 1. Unsigned arithmetic constant (4.2.3)
> 2. Symbolic name of an arithmetic constant (8.6)
> 3. Arithmetic variable reference (2.5)
> 4. Arithmetic array element reference (5.3)
> 5. Arithmetic function reference (15.2)
> 6. Arithmetic expression  enclosed  in  parentheses (6.1.2.4)

This is the archaic terminology for:

1. number literals
2. `parameter` constants
3. variables
4. array element name
5. function call
6. literally the `"(" expression ")"` rule

We have handled cases 1 and 6. "Named data references" must therefore
include cases 2 through 5.

### Variables

A variable is simply an identifier which is not followed by a left
parentheses (otherwise it would either be a function call or an array
element). 

### Function Calls

From the Fortran 90 grammars I have seen, usually the rule for a
function call is simply:

```enbf
function-reference = name "(" ")";
```

That is to say, it is a function invocation with zero parameters. This
is because we **know** it cannot possibly be an array element.

Function calls with arguments passed in, well, they're parsed using the
same rules as array element names, and then later determined to be
function calls or not. At least, that's the way it appears to me.

### Array Element Name

The grammar for an array element name looks like the following EBNF
grammar (according to sections 5.3 and 5.4 of the 77 Standard):

```ebnf
array-element-name = identifier "(" subscript-expr-list ")";

subscript-expr-list = subscript-expr {"," subscript-expr };

subscript-expr = int-literal
               | identifer;
```

However, in Section 6.2.2 of the 90 Standard, it allows array sections
(which is a cleaner way to organize the same results in the 77
Standard):

```ebnf
(* R611 *)
substring-range = [scalar-int-expr] ":" [scalar-int-expr] ;

(* R612 *)
data-ref = part-ref { "%" part-ref };

(* R613 *)
part-ref = part-name [ "(" section-subscript-list ")" ];
(* Constraint: in a `data-ref`, each `part-name` except the rightmost must
               be of a derived type. *)
(* Constraint: in a `data-ref`, each `part-name` except the leftmost must
               be the name of a component of the derived type
               definition of the type of the preceding `part-name`. *)
(* Constraint: in a `part-ref` containing a `section-subscript-list`, the
               number of `section-subscript`s must equal the rank of 
               `part-name`. *)
(* Constraint: in a `data-ref`, there must not be more than one `part-ref`
               with nonzero rank. A `part-name` to the right of a
               `part-ref` with nonzero rank must not have the POINTER
               attribute. *)

(* R614 *)
structure-component = data-ref; (* irrelevant for F77 *)

(* R615 *)
array-element = data-ref;
(* Constraint: in an array-element, every part-ref must have rank zero
               and the last part-ref must contain a subscript-list. *)

(* R616 *)
array-section = data-ref [ "(" substring-range ")" ] ;
(* Constraint: In array-section, exactly one part-ref must have nonzero rank,
               and either the final part-ref has a section-subscript-list
               with nonzero rank or another part-ref has a nonzero rank. *)
(* Constraint: In an array-section with a substring-range, the rightmost
               part-name must be of type character. *)

(* R617 *)
subscript = scalar-int-expr ;

(* R618 *)
section-subscript = subscript
                  | subscript-triplet
                  | vector-subscript ;

(* R619 *)
subscript-triplet = [subscript] ":" [subscript] [":" stride] ;

(* R620 *)
stride = scalar-int-expr ;

(* R621 *)
vector-subscript = int-expr ;
(* Constraint: vector-subscript must be  an integer array expression of
               rank 1 *)
```

Since there are no structures in F77, this simplifies to the following
grammar:

```ebnf
(* R611 *)
substring-range = [scalar-int-expr] ":" [scalar-int-expr] ;

(* R612 through R614, contracted *)
data-ref = part-name [ "(" section-subscript-list ")" ];

(* R615 *)
array-element = data-ref;
(* Constraint: in an array-element, every part-ref must have rank zero
               and the last part-ref must contain a subscript-list. *)

(* R616 *)
array-section = data-ref [ "(" substring-range ")" ] ;
(* Constraint: In array-section, exactly one part-ref must have nonzero rank,
               and either the final part-ref has a section-subscript-list
               with nonzero rank or another part-ref has a nonzero rank. *)
(* Constraint: In an array-section with a substring-range, the rightmost
               part-name must be of type character. *)

(* R617 *)
subscript = scalar-int-expr ;

(* R618 *)
section-subscript = subscript
                  | subscript-triplet
                  | vector-subscript ;

(* R619 *)
subscript-triplet = [subscript] ":" [subscript] [":" stride] ;

(* R620 *)
stride = scalar-int-expr ;

(* R621 *)
vector-subscript = int-expr ;
(* Constraint: vector-subscript must be  an integer array expression of
               rank 1 *)
```

Vector subscripts appear to be new to Fortran 90, the example from the
Standard is illuminating:

```f90
U = (/ 1, 3, 2 /)
V = (/ 2, 1, 1, 3 /)

Z(3, V) ! = (/ Z(3,2), Z(3,1), Z(3,1), Z(3,3) /)

Z(U, 2) ! = (/ Z(1,2), Z(3,2), Z(2,2) /)

Z(U, V) ! = (/ (/ Z(1,2), Z(1,1), Z(1,1), Z(1,3) /),
        !      (/ Z(3,2), Z(3,1), Z(3,1), Z(3,3) /),
        !      (/ Z(2,2), Z(2,1), Z(2,1), Z(2,3) /) /)
```

Recall:
- The "rank" of an array is the number of dimensions it has. Scalars
  have zero rank by convention.
- The "shape" of an array is a vector of integers, telling us the
  "extent" of [i.e., number of entries in] each dimension
- The "size" of an array is the total number of entries

```f90
! rank rexamples
INTEGER, DIMENSION (10) :: A     ! Rank = 1
REAL, DIMENSION (-5:5,100) :: B  ! Rank = 2

! shape examples
INTEGER, DIMENSION (10,10) :: A          ! Shape = (/ 10, 10 /)
REAL, DIMENSION (-5:4,1:10,10:19) :: B   ! Shape = (/ 10, 10, 10 /)

! size examples
INTEGER A(5)              ! Size = 5
REAL B(-1:0,1:3,4)        ! Size = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
```
